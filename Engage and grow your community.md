# Engage and grow your community

## Title in French \- Engager et aider à grandir la communauté

## Abstract

Behind every free idea, whether it is a software or a platform or a foundation, there is a community that animates it. This community can emerge spontaneously or be structured from the start, but at some point, it requires a little organization and direction. As in any group of people who share common interests, there can be moments of divergence or disagreement. This conference is feedback from more than 20 years of participation and guidance within large communities, with their strengths and weaknesses, and the exploration of the paths towards maturation and solidification of these communities.

French  
Derrière chaque idée libre, que ce soit un logiciel ou une plateforme ou une fondation, il y a une communauté qui l'anime. Cette communauté peut immerger de façon spontanée ou être structurée d'entrée, mais à un moment donné, il faut un peu d'organisation et de direction. Comme dans tout groupe de personnes qui partage des intérêts communs, il peut y avoir des moments de divergence ou désaccord.  
Cette conférence est un retour d'expérience de plus de 10 ans de participation et d'animation au sein d'une grande communauté, avec ses points forts et ses points faibles, et l'exploration des chemins vers une maturation et solidification de cette communauté.

# Context

After a few years participating actively and sometimes leading communities, I thought I would share some things I’ve learned, maybe some good practices, some bad practices and some things to experiment.

Different communities:

French Agile Community

5 different communities, 5 different styles.

# Different types of communities

Free/open source Software projects, User Groups (LUGs for example), Developer Communities, Hobby clubs

How to engage your community  
Despite the different types of communities, there are lots of commonalities and similar ways of engaging the members.

The goals and values of the community are important motivators. Depending on the founding ideas behind the community, these might be evident, or might need some exploration. 

Once the goal and values are clear (enough), the community can start growing and engaging its members. 

In general, in order to successfully engage and grow the community, it needs to be a safe place to share the common passion. While physical safety is essential, psychological safety is equally important. The members need to feel free to share their thoughts and feelings, without unpleasant consequences.

# Rules and regulations

No one ever likes to talk about them, but you’ll be glad you did

I especially like the Recurse Center’s [rules](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct)

## Statues

Depending on the type of community, you might have to have some legal statues

## Code of Conduct

A rather specific type of rules, which specifies how to interact respectfully. 

## Internal Regulations

Another rather specific type of rules, which can include how to resolve conflicts

## Legal Compliance

Depending on the location and activities, there are probably some legal obligations

# Discussions

You’ll probably need some kind of platform to facilitate discussion. It’s best to think and discuss before choosing.

# Finance

At some point, you’ll have expenses and maybe even have some funds

# Activities

This is probably the real reason the community exists, the uniting activities that motivates all of the members. There can be several different ones.

## Physical Activities

## Online Activities

## Asynchronous Activities

# Recruitment

How will you get people to join
